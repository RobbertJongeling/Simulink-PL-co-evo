--

3-way-merge-example contains the example models used to show the incorrect 3-way-merge of Simulink models (Figure 4 in the paper)

--

sldemo_fuelsys.slx contains the Simulink example that we base our models on.

Models N, N*, N1 are _org, _evo, and _var respectively (Figures 7, 8, 9 respectively in the paper)

--

ConQAT_output contains the results of executing the clone analysis on our examples.

getCloneScript.m contains the script used to convert the output of ConQAT into a list of handles that can be used to convert the clone into a subsystem.

--

The other .m scripts are used for breaking the link to the library subsystems and converting them into separate ones again.
They are called through the "Replace_MdlRef_SubSys" call in step 4 of the approach.
